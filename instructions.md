## Assignment 7
### Analyzing data
**due at 12 noon on 2015-11-05** via Github

## Instructions

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this [repository](https://github.com/PHY3009/assignment_7).

2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.

3. Create an iPython notebook called `Stats_in_Python.ipynb` in which you address the 
following:
	
	a. Load a dataset related to your proposal topic into an iPython notebook using the 
	Python library you think is most appropriate for that dataset.
	
	b. In a markdown cell in the notebook specify a question you would like to ask about 
	the dataset and your hypothesis.
	
	d. Choose a statistical test that addresses the question and apply it to the dataset.
	
	e. In another markdown cell in the notebook discuss the results from the statistical 
	test.

4. [**Add**](http://gitref.org/basic/#add) and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) 
changes to Git.

6. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push) the changes up to your copy of the 
repository on GitHub.

7. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) 
on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
